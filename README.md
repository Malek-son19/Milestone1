<h1>YouTube Focus Enhancer with Arabic Poetry</h1>

<h1>Features</h1>
-Poem Selection: A dropdown menu to choose from a collection of Arabic poems.
-Video Navigation: Buttons for moving to the next and previous poems/videos.
-Poem Descriptions: Each poem is accompanied by a short, simple description.
-Clean UI: The page minimizes distractions by focusing only on the video and poem information, without linking to external sites like YouTube.
