# YouTube Focus Enhancer with Arabic Poetry

This project provides a distraction-free YouTube viewing experience by embedding videos directly into a webpage. It helps users focus on content without the typical distractions of YouTube recommendations or ads. The project features a collection of Arabic poems as an example of how the platform can be used.

## Features

- **Poem Selection**: Choose from a collection of Arabic poems via a dropdown menu.
  
- **Video Navigation**: Easily move between poems using "Next" and "Previous" buttons.

- **Poem Descriptions**: Each poem is paired with a brief description to provide context.

- **Clean, Minimalist UI**: The interface eliminates distractions by focusing solely on the video and poem information, without redirecting to external sites like YouTube.

- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes for a customized viewing experience.
